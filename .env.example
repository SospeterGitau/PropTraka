# Example environment variables for local development
# DO NOT commit real credentials - use a service account in CI or local env and never check it into git.

# Firebase project (used for some local scripts)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=studio-4661291525-66fea

# If you're using the Firebase emulators, set the emulator hosts
# FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST and FIREBASE_AUTH_EMULATOR_HOST are optional; the emulator CLI usually sets them.
FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:8080
FIREBASE_AUTH_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:9099

# Path to service account JSON for certain local tasks (do NOT commit this file)
# GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./serviceAccountKey.json

# A secure password for the Iron session cookie (required). Use a long, random value.
# Example (do NOT commit your real secret):
# SESSION_PASSWORD=super-secret-long-password-CHANGE_ME

# You can store the service account JSON in an env var for CI or local helper scripts.
# Example (for GitHub Secrets):
# FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT={"type":"service_account", ... }
# Or locally write the file using the helper script after setting the secret:
# npm run service-account:write
# Note: the script writes to .firebase/service-account.json and the folder is gitignored.


# Local dev notes:
# - Start the emulator: `npm run emulator:start` (uses npx firebase emulators:start)
# - Seed the emulator: `npm run emulator:seed` (this script talks to the emulator at FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST)
# - Export emulator data: `npm run emulator:export` (writes to ./emulator-export)
# - Import emulator data on start: `npm run emulator:start:import`

# Safety: prevent accidental seeding of real projects. To intentionally seed a real Firestore, set:
# ALLOW_REAL_SEED=true
