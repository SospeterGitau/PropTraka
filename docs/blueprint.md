- Primary color: Slate blue (#708090) to convey professionalism and trustworthiness, reflecting the financial aspects of property management.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), offering a neutral backdrop that ensures legibility and reduces visual fatigue.
- Accent color: Soft green (#8FBC8F), used to highlight key interactive elements and positive financial indicators, linking to growth and stability.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif to offer a modern yet accessible look that is versatile for both headlines and body text.
- Use flat, line-based icons for a clean, modern look. Icons should be related to property, finance, and calendar events.
- Implement a grid-based layout for the dashboard and property management screens, ensuring consistent spacing and alignment. Use clear separation between sections to avoid clutter.
- Subtle transitions and animations should be used to provide feedback on user interactions (e.g., loading states, form submissions). Animations should be used sparingly to enhance, not distract from, the user experience.
