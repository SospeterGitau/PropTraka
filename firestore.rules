/**
 * @fileOverview
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for a rental property management application.
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring that only the authenticated user can access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}/properties/{propertyId}: Stores property details, owned by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/properties/{propertyId}/tenants/{tenantId}: Stores tenant details for a specific property.
 * - /users/{userId}/properties/{propertyId}/rentalPayments/{rentalPaymentId}: Stores rental payment information for a specific property.
 * - /users/{userId}/properties/{propertyId}/expenses/{expenseId}: Stores expense records for a specific property.
 * - /users/{userId}/properties/{propertyId}/appointments/{appointmentId}: Stores appointment details for a specific property.
 * - /users/{userId}/properties/{propertyId}/alerts/{alertId}: Stores alerts generated for a specific property.
 * - /users/{userId}/maintenanceRequests/{maintenanceRequestId}: Stores maintenance requests across all properties.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Strict Ownership: All documents are owned by a specific user, identified by their UID.
 * - No User Listing: Listing all users is not permitted.
 * - Authorization Independence: All subcollections include a `ownerId` field, copied from the parent `property`. This eliminates the need for `get()` calls in security rules.
