/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for rental property data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}/properties/{propertyId}: Properties owned by a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/properties/{propertyId}/tenants/{tenantId}: Tenants related to a specific property. Includes denormalized `ownerId`.
 * - /users/{userId}/properties/{propertyId}/rentalPayments/{rentalPaymentId}: Rental payments for a property. Includes denormalized `ownerId`.
 * - /users/{userId}/properties/{propertyId}/expenses/{expenseId}: Expenses for a property. Includes denormalized `ownerId`.
 * - /users/{userId}/properties/{propertyId}/appointments/{appointmentId}: Appointments for a property. Includes denormalized `ownerId`.
 * - /users/{userId}/properties/{propertyId}/alerts/{alertId}: Alerts for a property. Includes denormalized `ownerId`.
 * - /users/{userId}/maintenanceRequests/{maintenanceRequestId}: Maintenance requests, owned by a user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - All data is nested under /users/{userId}, enforcing user-based ownership.
 * - Subcollections include denormalized `ownerId` fields to avoid costly `get()` calls in rules.
 * - List operations are restricted to the owner for user-scoped subcollections.
