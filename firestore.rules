/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for rental property data.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring that users can only access their own data.
 * This ruleset prioritizes security and data privacy, restricting access to authorized users only.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}/properties/{propertyId}: Stores property details owned by a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/properties/{propertyId}/tenants/{tenantId}: Stores tenant information for a property.
 * - /users/{userId}/properties/{propertyId}/rentalPayments/{rentalPaymentId}: Stores rental payment records for a property.
 * - /users/{userId}/properties/{propertyId}/expenses/{expenseId}: Stores expense records for a property.
 * - /users/{userId}/properties/{propertyId}/appointments/{appointmentId}: Stores appointment records for a property.
 * - /users/{userId}/properties/{propertyId}/alerts/{alertId}: Stores alerts related to a property.
 * - /users/{userId}/maintenanceRequests/{maintenanceRequestId}: Stores maintenance requests created by a user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - All write operations are restricted to the owner of the data.
 * - Listing operations are restricted to the owner of the data.
 * - Data consistency is enforced by validating the userId in the path against the ownerId in the document.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Subcollections under properties (tenants, rentalPayments, expenses, appointments, alerts) include a denormalized `ownerId` field, copied from the parent `property`.
 *   This eliminates the need for `get()` calls in security rules, ensuring atomic operations and easy debugging.
