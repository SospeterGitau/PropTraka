/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for managing rental property data. All data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring that only the authenticated user can access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}/properties/{propertyId}: Represents a rental property owned by a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/properties/{propertyId}/tenants/{tenantId}: Represents a tenant renting a property owned by a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/properties/{propertyId}/rentalPayments/{rentalPaymentId}: Represents a rental payment made by a tenant for a specific property owned by a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/properties/{propertyId}/expenses/{expenseId}: Represents an expense related to a specific property owned by a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/properties/{propertyId}/appointments/{appointmentId}: Represents an appointment related to a specific property owned by a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/properties/{propertyId}/alerts/{alertId}: Represents an alert related to a specific property owned by a specific user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Strict user-ownership: Only the authenticated user can create, read, update, or delete data under their /users/{userId} path.
 * - No user listing: Listing all users is not allowed.
 * - Denormalization for Authorization: Subcollections include a denormalized `ownerId` field, copied from the parent `property` document, which simplifies security rules and improves performance by avoiding costly `get()` calls.
 * - Data Consistency: Rules validate that the userId in the path matches the ownerId in the document data during creation to prevent unauthorized data creation.
