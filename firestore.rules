/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is stored in top-level collections such as /properties/{propertyId}, /revenue/{transactionId}, etc.
 * Each document in these collections must contain an 'ownerId' field that matches the UID of the authenticated user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access documents where the 'ownerId' field matches their own UID.
 * - Listing of documents is allowed only if the query includes a where('ownerId', '==', user.uid) clause,
 *   ensuring that users can only list documents they own.
 * - Data validation is relaxed during this prototyping phase to allow for rapid iteration,
 *   but the 'ownerId' field is strictly enforced for all write operations to maintain authorization.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The 'ownerId' field is denormalized directly onto each document to enable efficient authorization checks
 * without requiring additional reads.
