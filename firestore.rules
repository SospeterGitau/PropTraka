/**
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data. Each document
 * is secured such that only the owner (identified by `ownerId`) can create, read, update, or delete it.
 * @dataStructure All data is stored in top-level collections: `/properties/{propertyId}`,
 * `/revenue/{transactionId}`, `/expenses/{transactionId}`, `/maintenanceRequests/{requestId}`, and `/changelog/{logId}`.
 * @keySecurityDecisions Listing of the `changelog` collection is only available to authenticated users.
 * All other collections are not listable via the client.
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization Each document contains an `ownerId` field that MUST match the
 * authenticated user's UID to grant access. This avoids costly `get()` calls in the rules.
