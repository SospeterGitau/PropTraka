/**
 * @fileOverview
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for managing rental property data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, with properties, tenants, rental payments, expenses, appointments, alerts, and maintenance requests organized as subcollections.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disabled for all collections.
 * - All write operations are restricted to the owner of the data.
 * - Subcollections inherit ownership from their parent property document, eliminating the need for complex `get()` calls in rules.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Subcollections under `/users/{userId}/properties/{propertyId}` (tenants, rentalPayments, expenses, appointments, alerts) include a denormalized `ownerId` field, copied from the parent `property`.
 *   This allows rules on these subcollections to directly check ownership without additional reads.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Maintenance requests are stored in a separate top-level collection `/users/{userId}/maintenanceRequests/{maintenanceRequestId}` to allow for easy querying across all properties owned by a user.
