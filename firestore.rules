/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /properties/{propertyId}: Stores property details, accessible only to the owner.
 * - /revenue/{transactionId}: Stores revenue transactions, accessible only to the owner.
 * - /expenses/{transactionId}: Stores expense transactions, accessible only to the owner.
 * - /maintenanceRequests/{requestId}: Stores maintenance requests, accessible only to the owner.
 * - /changelog/{logId}: Stores activity log entries, accessible only to the owner.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Listing of any collections is not allowed except for owner
 *
 * Access Control Patterns:
 * - /properties/{propertyId}: Ownership
 * - /revenue/{transactionId}: Ownership
 * - /expenses/{transactionId}: Ownership
 * - /maintenanceRequests/{requestId}: Ownership
 * - /changelog/{logId}: Ownership
