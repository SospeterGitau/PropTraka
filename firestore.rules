/**
 * @fileOverview
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data, ensuring that only the authenticated user who owns the data can access it.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, with further subcollections for properties and related data (tenants, rental payments, expenses, appointments, alerts, maintenanceRequests).
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Listing properties and maintenance requests is restricted to the owner.
 * - All subcollections inherit ownership from their parent property, enforced through an `ownerId` field on each document. This avoids costly `get()` calls in security rules.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * All subcollections (tenants, rentalPayments, expenses, appointments, alerts) under /users/{userId}/properties/{propertyId} include an `ownerId` field that MUST match the `userId` in the path. This denormalization is critical for authorization independence, ensuring that rules can be evaluated without needing to read parent documents.
